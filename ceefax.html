Remember Ceefax? I shouldn't, but I do. Gone are the days of page 316 bringing you LIVE footie scores on a Saturday teatime. 
When I were a lad, Ceefax was a quicker way of getting a weather forecast than turning on the computer with its dial up modem (and there was no way I'd get permission from my parents to do something as wasteful as use the Internet at age 6). 
<p>
I've tried to recreate the Ceefax weather maps using relatively recent data from the Met Office.
<p>
This is just a bit of fun, and my mangling of the forecast data probably means it's very wrong. Don't use this for your actual weather forecast. Use the Met Office website or something modern and useful like that instead.
<p>
Still though, worth spending a day making this, right?
<p>
Feel free to share these images. Why you'd want to is another question.
<p>
These maps should update around 7 am (UK time) each day.
