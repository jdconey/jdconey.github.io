Ceefax Weather Map
</h1>

Remember Ceefax? I shouldn't, but I do. Gone are the days of page 316 bringing you LIVE footie scores on a Saturday teatime. 
The weather maps made an impression on me as a child, because Ceefax was a quicker way of getting weather information than turning on the computer with its dial up modem. 
It just made sense.

So here, nobody asked, but I've tried to recreate the Ceefax weather maps using relatively recent data from the Met Office.

This is just a bit of fun. For goodness sake don't use this for your actual weather forecast. Use the Met Office website or something like that instead.

Still though, worth spending a day making this, right?
