@article{Weatherhead2018,
  abstract = {Climate observations are needed to address a large range of important societal issues including sea level rise, droughts, floods, extreme heat events, food security, and freshwater availability in the coming decades. Past, targeted investments in specific climate questions have resulted in tremendous improvements in issues important to human health, security, and infrastructure. However, the current climate observing system was not planned in a comprehensive, focused manner required to adequately address the full range of climate needs. A potential approach to planning the observing system of the future is presented in this article. First, this article proposes that priority be given to the most critical needs as identified within the World Climate Research Program as Grand Challenges. These currently include seven important topics: melting ice and global consequences; clouds, circulation and climate sensitivity; carbon feedbacks in the climate system; understanding and predicting weather and climate extremes; water for the food baskets of the world; regional sea-level change and coastal impacts; and near-term climate prediction. For each Grand Challenge, observations are needed for long-term monitoring, process studies and forecasting capabilities. Second, objective evaluations of proposed observing systems, including satellites, ground-based and in situ observations as well as potentially new, unidentified observational approaches, can quantify the ability to address these climate priorities. And third, investments in effective climate observations will be economically important as they will offer a magnified return on investment that justifies a far greater development of observations to serve society's needs.},

Crowdsourcing, i.e., collection of atmospheric data from non-traditional sources like citizen weather stations (CWS), is an alternative and cost-efficient method for exploration and monitoring of urban climates. This study examines the suitability of crowdsourced air temperature (Tcrowd) measurements from CWS by comparing Tcrowd from up to 1500 stations with reference air temperature (Tref) in Berlin and surroundings for a period of twelve months (Jan–Dec 2015). Comprehensive quality assessment of Tcrowd reveals that erroneous metadata, failure of data collection, and unsuitable exposure of sensors lead to a reduction of data availability by 53{\%}. Spatially aggregated raw data of Tcrowd already provide a robust estimate of hourly and daily urban air temperature in the study area. Quality-checked Tcrowd observations show spatio-temporal characteristics of the urban heat island in Berlin with higher spatial variability than Tref in built-up areas. Spatial density of Tcrowd in Berlin exceeds that of the reference monitoring network by far. However, rigorous data quality assessment is the key challenge in order to fully benefit from this novel data set for urban climate research.},

abstract = {Citizen weather stations are rapidly increasing in prevalence and are becoming an emerging source of weather information. These low-cost consumer-grade devices provide observations in real time and form parts of dense networks that capture high-resolution meteorological information. Despite these benefits, their adoption into operational weather prediction systems has been slow. However, MET Norway recently introduced observations from Netatmo's network of weather stations in the postprocessing of near-surface temperature forecasts for Scandinavia, Finland, and the Baltic countries. The observations are used to continually correct errors in the weather model output caused by unresolved features such as cold pools, inversions, urban heat islands, and an intricate coastline. Corrected forecasts are issued every hour. Integrating citizen observations into operational systems comes with a number of challenges. First, operational systems must be robust and therefore rely on strict quality control procedures to filter out unreliable measurements. Second, postprocessing methods must be selected and tuned to make use of the high-resolution data that at times can contain conflicting information. Central to resolving these challenges is the need to use the massive redundancy of citizen observations, with up to dozens of observations per square kilometer, and treating the data source as a network rather than a collection of individual stations. We present our experiences with introducing citizen observations into the operational production chain of automated public weather forecasts. Their inclusion shows a clear improvement to the accuracy of short-term temperature forecasts, especially in areas where existing professional stations are sparse.},

  abstract = {A computational framework to generate daily temperature maps using time-series of publicly available MODIS MOD11A2 product Land Surface Temperature (LST) images (1 km resolution; 8-day composites) is illustrated using temperature measurements from the national network of meteorological stations (159) in Croatia. The input data set contains 57,282 ground measurements of daily temperature for the year 2008. Temperature was modeled as a function of latitude, longitude, distance from the sea, elevation, time, insolation, and the MODIS LST images. The original rasters were first converted to principal components to reduce noise and filter missing pixels in the LST images. The residual were next analyzed for spatio-temporal auto-correlation; sum-metric separable variograms were fitted to account for zonal and geometric space-time anisotropy. The final predictions were generated for time-slices of a 3D space-time cube, constructed in the R environment for statistical computing. The results show that the space-time regression model can explain a significant part of the variation in station-data (84{\%}). MODIS LST 8-day (cloud-free) images are unbiased estimator of the daily temperature, but with relatively low precision (±4. 1°C); however their added value is that they systematically improve detection of local changes in land surface temperature due to local meteorological conditions and/or active heat sources (urban areas, land cover classes). The results of 10-fold cross-validation show that use of spatio-temporal regression-kriging and incorporation of time-series of remote sensing images leads to significantly more accurate maps of temperature than if plain spatial techniques were used. The average (global) accuracy of mapping temperature was ±2. 4°C. The regression-kriging explained 91{\%} of variability in daily temperatures, compared to 44{\%} for ordinary kriging. Further software advancement-interactive space-time variogram exploration and automated retrieval, resampling and filtering of MODIS images-are anticipated. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Crowdsourcing of rainfall measurements incorporating common citizens as a rich source of data is an emerging concept with huge potential to provide valuable high spatiotemporal resolution rainfall observations. Here we investigate the merging of crowdsourced rainfall data with traditional radar and rain gauge data to maximize their utility. For this purpose, we develop a tailored fast Bayesian regression kriging (FBRK) method combining regression kriging and Laplace approximation in a Bayesian framework. A strength of the FBRK method lies in its ability to capture the differences between rain gauge and crowdsourced measurement errors. Another lies in its fast yet reasonably accurate approximation of the Bayesian posterior, making it suitable to use in real time. We conduct synthetic computer simulations to evaluate the FBRK method alongside three other merging methods. In the simulations, we compare the accuracies of their resulting rainfall estimates, as well as the skill of those estimates as input to a storm water flow forecasting model. In both aspects, we observe the FBRK method to lead to more accurate results and truer representations of the associated uncertainties. However, we also observe the performance of the FBRK method to be sensitive to the choice of the Bayesian prior under certain conditions. Finally, from the synthetic simulations, we find merging crowdsourced data with traditional data to lead to more accurate estimation of the ground truth rainfall field and, subsequently, more accurate flow forecasts (though only when an adequate merging method, e.g., the FBRK method, is used), and the results to be fairly robust to bias in the input crowdsourced data.},

  abstract = {Crowdsourcing is traditionally defined as obtaining data or information by enlisting the services of a (potentially large) number of people. However, due to recent innovations, this definition can now be expanded to include 'and/or from a range of public sensors, typically connected via the Internet.' A large and increasing amount of data is now being obtained from a huge variety of non-traditional sources - from smart phone sensors to amateur weather stations to canvassing members of the public. Some disciplines (e.g. astrophysics, ecology) are already utilizing crowdsourcing techniques (e.g. citizen science initiatives, web 2.0 technology, low-cost sensors), and while its value within the climate and atmospheric science disciplines is still relatively unexplored, it is beginning to show promise. However, important questions remain; this paper introduces and explores the wide-range of current and prospective methods to crowdsource atmospheric data, investigates the quality of such data and examines its potential applications in the context of weather, climate and society. It is clear that crowdsourcing is already a valuable tool for engaging the public, and if appropriate validation and quality control procedures are adopted and implemented, it has much potential to provide a valuable source of high temporal and spatial resolution, real-time data, especially in regions where few observations currently exist, thereby adding value to science, technology and society.},

@article{DeVos2017,
  abstract = {The high density of built-up areas and resulting imperviousness of the land surface makes urban areas vulnerable to extreme rainfall, which can lead to considerable damage. In order to design and manage cities to be able to deal with the growing number of extreme rainfall events, rainfall data are required at higher temporal and spatial resolutions than those needed for rural catchments. However, the density of operational rainfall monitoring networks managed by local or national authorities is typically low in urban areas. A growing number of automatic personal weather stations (PWSs) link rainfall measurements to online platforms. Here, we examine the potential of such crowdsourced datasets for obtaining the desired resolution and quality of rainfall measurements for the capital of the Netherlands. Data from 63 stations in Amsterdam (∼75 km2) that measure rainfall over at least 4 months in a 17-month period are evaluated. In addition, a detailed assessment is made of three Netatmo stations, the largest contributor to this dataset, in an experimental setup. The sensor performance in the experimental setup and the density of the PWS network are promising. However, features in the online platforms, like rounding and thresholds, cause changes from the original time series, resulting in considerable errors in the datasets obtained. These errors are especially large during low-intensity rainfall, although they can be reduced by accumulating rainfall over longer intervals. Accumulation improves the correlation coefficient with gauge-adjusted radar data from 0.48 at 5 min intervals to 0.60 at hourly intervals. Spatial rainfall correlation functions derived from PWS data show much more small-scale variability than those based on gauge-adjusted radar data and those found in similar research using dedicated rain gauge networks. This can largely be attributed to the noise in the PWS data resulting from both the measurement setup and the processes occurring in the data transfer to the online PWS platform. A double mass comparison with gauge-adjusted radar data shows that the median of the stations resembles the rainfall reference better than the real-time (unadjusted) radar product. Averaging nearby raw PWS measurements further improves the match with gauge-adjusted radar data in that area. These results confirm that the growing number of internet-connected PWSs could successfully be used for urban rainfall monitoring.},

@article{Hughes2015,
  abstract = {The formation of cold air pools in valleys under stable conditions represents an important challenge for numerical weather prediction (NWP). The challenge is increased when the valleys that dominate cold pool formation are on scales unresolved by NWP models, which can lead to substantial local errors in temperature forecasts. In this study a 2-month simulation is presented using a nested model configuration with a finest horizontal grid spacing of 100 m. The simulation is compared with observations from the recent COLd air Pooling Experiment (COLPEX) project and the model's ability to represent cold pool formation, and the surface energy balance is assessed. The results reveal a bias in the model long-wave radiation that results from the assumptions made about the sub-grid variability in humidity in the cloud parametrization scheme. The cloud scheme assumes relative humidity thresholds below 100 {\%} to diagnose partial cloudiness, an approach common to schemes used in many other models. The biases in radiation, and resulting biases in screen temperature and cold pool properties are shown to be sensitive to the choice of critical relative humidity, suggesting that this is a key area that should be improved for very high-resolution modeling.},

@article{Merchant2020,
  abstract = {Optimal estimation (OE) is a core method in quantitative Earth observation. The optimality of OE depends on the errors in the prior, measurements and forward model being zero mean and having well-known error covariance. Often these assumptions are not met. We show how to use matches of satellite observations to in situ reference measurements to estimate parameters for use in OE that bring the retrieval framework closer to the theoretical optimality. This is done by retrieving bias correction and error covariance parameters. Bias correction parameters for some components of the retrieved state and for the satellite radiances are anchored by the in situ reference measurements, and are obtained by a modification of Kalman filtering. Error covariance matrices for the prior state and for the observation-simulation difference are iteratively obtained by applying equations for diagnosing internal retrieval consistency. The theory is applied to the case of OE of sea surface temperature from a sensor on a geostationary platform. Relative to an initial OE implementation, all measures of retrieval performance are improved when the optimised OE is tested on independent data: mean difference from validation data is reduced from −0.08 K to −0.01 K, and the standard deviation from 0.47 to 0.45 K; retrieval sensitivity to sea surface temperature increases from 71{\%} to 76{\%}; and a 20{\%} underestimation of retrieval uncertainty is corrected. Perhaps more significant than the quantitative improvements are the coherent new insights into the forward model simulations and prior assumptions that are also obtained. These include estimates of prior bias in the absence of in situ information, an important consideration when in situ information is not globally distributed. Biases and lack of information about error covariances arise in remote sensing very often. While illustrated here for a particular case, the principles and methods we present for constraining that lack of knowledge systematically using ground truth will be widely applicable in remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Although the first-order pattern of present-day deformation is relatively well resolved across the Himalayas, irregular data coverage limits detailed analyses of spatial variations of interseismic coupling. We provide the first GPS velocity field for the Bhutan Himalaya. Combined with published data, these observations show strong east-west variations in coupling between central and eastern Bhutan. In contrast with previous estimations of first-order uniform interseismic coupling along the Himalayan arc, we identify significant lateral variations: In western and central Bhutan, the fully coupled segment is 135–155 km wide with an abrupt downdip transition, whereas in eastern Bhutan the fully coupled segment is 100–120 km wide and is limited updip and downdip by partially creeping segments. This is the first observation of decoupling on the upper ramp along the Himalayan arc, with important implications for large earthquake surface rupture and seismic hazard.},

In order to prepare cities for these types of flood events - especially in the future climate - it is valuable to be able to simulate these events numerically, both historically and in real-time. There is a rather untested potential in real-time prediction of urban floods. In this paper, radar data observations with different spatial and temporal resolution, radar nowcasts of 0-2 h leadtime, and numerical weather models with leadtimes up to 24 h are used as inputs to an integrated flood and drainage systems model in order to investigate the relative difference between different inputs in predicting future floods. The system is tested on the small town of Lystrup in Denmark, which was flooded in 2012 and 2014. Results show it is possible to generate detailed flood maps in real-time with high resolution radar rainfall data, but rather limited forecast performance in predicting floods with leadtimes more than half an hour.},

  abstract = {In urban areas, dense atmospheric observational networks with high-quality data are still a challenge due to high costs for installation and maintenance over time. Citizen weather stations (CWS) could be one answer to that issue. Since more and more owners of CWS share their measurement data publicly, crowdsourcing, i.e., the automated collection of large amounts of data from an undefined crowd of citizens, opens new pathways for atmospheric research. However, the most critical issue is found to be the quality of data from such networks. In this study, a statistically-based quality control (QC) is developed to identify suspicious air temperature (T) measurements from crowdsourced data sets. The newly developed QC exploits the combined knowledge of the dense network of CWS to statistically identify implausible measurements, independent of external reference data. The evaluation of the QC is performed using data from Netatmo CWS in Toulouse, France, and Berlin, Germany, over a 1-year period (July 2016 to June 2017), comparing the quality-controlled data with data from two networks of reference stations. The new QC efficiently identifies erroneous data due to solar exposition and siting issues, which are common error sources of CWS. Estimation of T is improved when averaging data from a group of stations within a restricted area rather than relying on data of individual CWS. However, a positive deviation in CWS data compared to reference data is identified, particularly for daily minimum T. To illustrate the transferability of the newly developed QC and the applicability of CWS data, a mapping of T is performed over the city of Paris, France, where spatial density of CWS is especially high.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of sonic anemometer-derived stress estimates to the tilt of the anemometer is investigated. The largest stress errors are shown to occur for unstable stratification (z/L {\textless} 0) and deep convective boundary layers. Three methods for determining the tilt angles relative to a mean streamline coordinate system and for computing the tilt-corrected stresses are then compared. The most commonly used method, involving a double rotation of the anemometers' axes, is shown to result in significant run-to-run stress errors due to the sampling uncertainty of the mean vertical velocity. An alternative method, requiring a triple rotation of the anemometer axes, is shown to result in even greater run-to-run stress errors due to the combined sampling errors of the mean vertical velocity and the crosswind stress. For measurements over the sea where the cross-stream stress is important, the double rotation method is shown to overestimate the surface stress, due to the uncorrected lateral tilt component. A third method, using a planar fit technique, is shown to reduce the run-to-run stress errors due to sampling effects, and provides an unbiased estimate of the lateral stress.},

The privatisation of meteorological services in some countries (e.g. New Zealand) and the vigorous commercialisation of established Met. Offices such as in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden suggests that customer satisfaction, increased income and reduced expenditure will dominate the weather forecasting scene over the next decade. It is important that the quality of weather forecasts is closely monitored before and after commercialisation to ensure that the accuracy of weather forecasts continues to improve and that public weather forecasting does not suffer. The improved technologies for data collection such as weather satellites, weather radar, wind profilers, road weather information systems, sferics, etc. should make it easier to assess forecast accuracy-but with the exception of road weather forecasts there is little sign that the new technology has been used for this purpose. The current accuracy of a sample of weather forecasts in the U K is discussed and a framework for publishing future weather forecast ver{\$}cation statistics is presented.},

  abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The lack of observations near the surface is often cited as a limiting factor in the observation and prediction of deep convection. Recently, networks of personal weather stations (PWSs) measuring pressure, temperature and humidity in near-real time have been rapidly developing. Even if they suffer from quality issues, their high temporal resolution and their higher spatial density than standard weather station (SWS) networks have aroused interest in using them to observe deep convection. In this study, the PWSs contribution to the observation of deep-convection features near the ground is evaluated. Four cases of deep convection in 2018 over France were considered using data from Netatmo, a PWS manufacturer. A fully automatic PWS processing algorithm, including PWS quality control, was developed. After processing, the mean number of observations available increased by a factor of 134 in mean sea level pressure (MSLP), of 11 in temperature and of 14 in relative humidity over the areas of study. Near-surface SWS analyses, and analyses comprising standard and personal weather stations (SPWS) were built. The usefulness of crowdsourced data was proven both objectively and subjectively for deep convection observation. Objective validations of SWS and SPWS analyses by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) were performed using SWSs as the validation dataset. Over the four cases, LOOCV root mean square errors (RMSEs) decreased for all parameters in SPWS analyses compared to SWS analyses. RMSEs decreased by 73 to 77{\&}thinsp;{\%} in MSLP, 12 to 23{\&}thinsp;{\%} in temperature and 17 to 21{\&}thinsp;{\%} in relative humidity. Subjectively, fine-scale structures showed up in SPWS analyses, while partly or not at all visible in SWS observations only. MSLP jumps accompanying squall lines or individual cells were observed, as well as wake lows at the rear of these lines. Temperature drops and humidity rises accompanying most of the storms were observed sooner and at a finer resolution in SPWS analyses than in SWS analyses. The virtual potential temperature was spatialized at an unprecedented spatial resolution. It gave the opportunity to observe cold pool propagation and secondary convective initiation over areas with high virtual potential temperatures, i.e. favorable locations for near surface parcel lifting.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Smartphone pressure observations can potentially help improve numerical weather prediction and aid forecasters. In this contribution a method of collecting data from smartphones is presented, other methods are discussed and guidelines are derived from the experience. Quality control is vital when using crowd-sourced data. Screening methods aimed at smartphone pressure observations are presented. Results from previous studies, showing a substantial but long-term stable bias in combination with high relative accuracy, are confirmed. The collection of Danish smartphone pressure observations has been very successful, with over 6 million observations during a 7 week period. Case studies show that distinct weather patterns can be seen in unprocessed data. The screening method developed reduces the observational noise but filters out the majority of observations. Assimilating smartphone pressure observations in a single case study, using the 3D variational data assimilation system of the HARMONIE numerical weather prediction system, proved to decrease the bias of surface pressure in the model without increasing the root mean square error and the skill of accumulated precipitation increased. It is found that the altitude assignment of smartphones needs improvement.},

While there are sensing modalities for each of the above types of information (e.g. current sensors for appliances) the fact that they can all be detected by such a simple sensor is highly relevant for practical activity recognition systems. Compared to vision (or thermal imaging systems) the system has the advantage is being less privacy invasive allowing it for example to monitor bathroom activities (as shown in one of our evaluation scenarios).

  abstract = {Crowd-sourced environmental observations are increasingly being considered as having the potential to enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of current data streams from terrestrial and areal sensors. The rapid diffusion of ICTs during the past decades has facilitated the process of data collection and sharing by the general public and has resulted in the formation of various online environmental citizen observatory networks. Online amateur weather networks are a particular example of such ICT-mediated observatories that are rooted in one of the oldest and most widely practiced citizen science activities, namely amateur weather observation. The objective of this paper is to introduce a conceptual framework that enables a systematic review of the features and functioning of these expanding networks. This is done by considering distinct dimensions, namely the geographic scope and types of participants, the network's establishment mechanism, revenue stream(s), existing communication paradigm, efforts required by data sharers, support offered by platform providers, and issues such as data accessibility, availability and quality. An in-depth understanding of these dimensions helps to analyze various dynamics such as interactions between different stakeholders, motivations to run the networks, and their sustainability. This framework is then utilized to perform a critical review of six existing online amateur weather networks based on publicly available data. The main findings of this analysis suggest that: (1) there are several key stakeholders such as emergency services and local authorities that are not (yet) engaged in these networks; (2) the revenue stream(s) of online amateur weather networks is one of the least discussed but arguably most important dimensions that is crucial for the sustainability of these networks; and (3) all of the networks included in this study have one or more explicit modes of bi-directional communication, however, this is limited to feedback mechanisms that are mainly designed to educate the data sharers.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the history of surface weather observations in the United States is reviewed. Local weather observations were first documented in the 17th Century along the East Coast. For many years, the progression of a weather observation from an initial reading to dissemination remained a slow and laborious process. The number of observers remained small and unorganized until agencies including the Surgeon General, Army, and General Land Office began to request regular observations at satellite locations in the 1800s. The Smithsonian was responsible for first organizing a large network of volunteer weather observers across the nation. These observers became the foundation for today's Cooperative Observer network. As applications of weather data continued to grow and users required the data with an ever-decreasing latency, automated weather networks saw rapid growth in the later part of the 20th century. Today, the number of weather observations across the U.S. totals in the tens of thousands due largely to privately-owned weather networks and amateur weather observers who submit observations over the internet. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The instruments were installed for verification of radar hydrometeor classification algorithms but are valuable for much wider use in the scientific and operational meteorological community. Every Thies LPM is able to designate each observed hydrometeor into one of 20 diameter bins from span classCombining double low line inline-formula 0.125/span to span classCombining double low line inline-formula 8/spanmm and one of 22 speed bins from span classCombining double low line inline-formula 0.0/span to span classCombining double low line inline-formula 20.0/spanmsspan classCombining double low line inline-formula -1/span. Using empirically derived relationships, the instrument classifies precipitation into one of 11 possible hydrometeor classes in the form of a present weather code, with an associated indicator of uncertainty. To provide immediate feedback to data users, the observations are plotted in near-real time (NRT) and made publicly available on a website within 7min. Here we describe the Disdrometer Verification Network and present specific cases from the first year of observations. Cases shown here suggest that the Thies LPM performs well at identifying transitions between rain and snow, but struggles with detection of graupel and pristine ice crystals (which occur infrequently in the United Kingdom) inherently, due to internal processing. The present weather code quality index is shown to have some skill without the supplementary sensors recommended by the manufacturer. Overall the Thies LPM is a useful tool for detecting hydrometeor type at the surface and DiVeN provides a novel dataset not previously observed for the United Kingdom.},

  abstract = {Today we have access to a vast amount of weather, air quality, noise or radioactivity data collected by individual around the globe. This volunteered geographic information often contains data of uncertain and of heterogeneous quality, in particular when compared to official in-situ measurements. This limits their application, as rigorous, work-intensive data cleaning has to be performed, which reduces the amount of data and cannot be performed in real-time. In this paper, we propose dynamically learning the quality of individual sensors by optimizing a weighted Gaussian process regression using an evolutionary algorithm. The evaluation is done for the southwest of Germany in August 2016 with temperature data from the Wunderground network and the Deutsche Wetter Dienst (DWD), in total 1,561 stations. Using a 10-fold cross-validation scheme based on the DWD ground truth, we can show significant improvements of the predicted sensor reading. In our experiment we were obtain a 12.5{\%} improvement on the mean absolute error.},

  abstract = {A spatial consistency test (SCT) is applied to temperature observations of a high-resolution meteorological network composed of automatic surface weather stations. The SCT's purpose is twofold: preventing gross errors (GEs) from entering automatic numerical elaborations and returning a spatial consistency flag to an external quality-control system. The algorithm is based on Bayesian concepts and exploits the existing objective analysis scheme by comparing each observed value with the corresponding cross-validation (CV) analysis value. Local data density is automatically taken into account to allow a less restrictive test for isolated stations that provide precious information on poorly observed areas. Thresholds and parameters are estimated statistically for large datasets, thus eliminating any subjective and ad hoc tuning. Misjudgment rates are estimated for both missed and false rejections. Special attention is devoted to the problem of large representativity errors which, being dependent on a prescribed scale, do require multiple cross-checks to avoid confusion with proper GEs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Royal Meteorological Society.},

This paper describes novel approaches for the collection, quality control, and bias correction of such smartphone pressures. An Android app was developed and distributed to several thousand users, serving as a test bed for onboard pressure collection and quality-control strategies. New methods of pressure collection were evaluated, with a focus on reducing and quantifying sources of observation error and uncertainty. Using a machine learning approach, complex relationships between pressure bias and ancillary sensor data were used to predict and correct future pressure biases over a 4-week period from 10 November to 5 December 2016. This approach, in combination with simple quality-control checks, produced an 82{\%} reduction in the average smartphone pressure bias, substantially improving the quality of smartphone pressures and facilitating their use in numerical weather prediction. {\textcopyright} 2018 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {Crowdsourcing techniques are frequently used across science to supplement traditional means of data collection. Although atmospheric science has so far been slow to harness the technology, developments have now reached the point where the benefits of the approaches simply cannot be ignored: crowdsourcing has potentially far-reaching consequences for the way in which measurements are collected and used in the discipline. To illustrate this point, this paper uses air temperature data from the prolific, low-cost, Netatmo weather station to quantify the urban heat island of London over the summer of 2015. The results are broadly comparable with previous studies, and indeed standard observations (albeit with a warm bias, a likely consequence of non-standard site exposure), showing a range of magnitudes of between 1 and 6 °C across the city depending on atmospheric stability. However, not all the results can be easily explained by physical processes and therefore highlight quality issues with crowdsourced data that need to be resolved. This paper aims to kickstart a step-change in the use of crowdsourcing in urban meteorology by encouraging atmospheric scientists to more positively engage with the new generation of manufacturers producing mass market sensors.},

@article{Krennert2018,
  abstract = {Abstract. Information from voluntary storm spotters has been an increasingly important part for the severe weather warning process at the Zentralanstalt f{\"{u}}r Meteorologie and Geodynamik (ZAMG), Austria's National Weather Service, for almost 15 years. In 2010 a collaboration was formalized and an annual training was established to educate voluntary observers into “Trusted Spotters”. The return of this investment is a higher credibility of their observations after these spotters have undergone a basic meteorological training and have become aware of their responsibility. The European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL) was included to this collaboration to adopt their successful quality control system of severe weather reports, which is employed in the European Severe Weather Database ESWD. That way, reports from Trusted Spotters automatically obtain a higher quality flag, which enables a faster processing by forecasters on duty for severe weather warnings, when time is a critical issue. The concept of combining training for voluntary storm spotters and a thorough quality management was recognized as a “Best Practice Model” by the European Meteorological Society. We propose to apply this concept also in other European countries and present its advancement into an even broader, pan-European approach. The European Weather Observer app EWOB, recently released by ESSL, provides a novel and easy-to-handle tool to submit weather and respective impact observations. We promote its use to provide better data and information for a further real-time improvement of severe weather warnings.},

Precipitation type choice is made via a drop-down list or menu. Users simply select the observed precipitation type, at which point the app returns to the submit page. Two taps of the screen are all that is needed to submit an observation once the app is opened. An extra tap is needed for hail because the user must select thehail size using a slider bar. Both the mobile apps and the web page submit information via HTTP to a common database that validates user input and provides persistent storage of the public reports. The app itself is not static, enhancements have already been made and additional mobile platforms may be considered in the future.},
