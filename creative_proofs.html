<title>How to Write like a Mathematician</title>
<h1>How to Write like a Mathematician</h1>
<body>
Many folk, when writing a proof, resort to the same old selection of words: "hence"; "clearly"; "therefore"; and so on.
This is intended to be a short "thesaurus" if you like, to inspire your proofs to new levels of greatness and creativity.

<b>List</b>
<p>Obviously<br>
Clearly<br>
Anyone can see that<br>
Trivially<br>
Indubitably<br>
It follows that<br>
Evidently<br>
By basic applications of previously proven lemmas,<br>
The proof is left to the reader that<br>
It goes without saying that<br>
Consequently<br>
By immediate consequence,<br>
Of course<br>
But then again<br>
By symmetry<br>
Without loss of generality,<br>
Anyone with a fifth grade education can see that<br>
I would wager 5 dollars that<br>
By the contrapositive<br>
We need not waste ink in proving that<br>
By Euler<br>
By Fermat<br>
By a simple diagonalization argument,<br>
We all agree that<br>
It would be absurd to deny that<br>
Unquestionably,<br>
Indisputably,<br>
It is plain to see that<br>
It would be embarrassing to miss the fact that<br>
It would be an insult to my time and yours to prove that<br>
Any cretin with half a brain could see that<br>
By Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem,<br>
By the Axiom of Choice,<br>
It is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis that<br>
By a simple counting argument,<br>
Simply put,<br>
One&rsquo;s mind immediately leaps to the conclusion that<br>
By contradiction,<br>
I shudder to think of the poor soul who denies that<br>
It is readily apparent to the casual observer that<br>
With p < 5% we conclude that<br>
It follows from the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms that<br>
Set theory tells us that<br>
Divine inspiration reveals to us that<br>
Patently,<br>
Needless to say,<br>
By logic<br>
By the Laws of Mathematics<br>
By all means,<br>
With probability 1,<br>
Who could deny that<br>
Assuming the Continuum Hypothesis,<br>
Galois died in order to show us that<br>
There is a marvellous proof (which is too long to write here) that<br>
We proved in class that<br>
Our friends over at Harvard recently discovered that<br>
It is straightforward to show that<br>
There is not enough space in the margin to show that<br>
By definition,<br>
By a simple assumption,<br>
It is easy to see that<br>
Even you would be able to see that<br>
Everybody knows that<br>
I don&rsquo;t know why anybody would ask, but<br>
Between you and me,<br>
Unless you accept G&ouml;del&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorem,<br>
A reliable source has told me<br>
It is a matter of simple arithmetic to show that<br>
Beyond a shadow of a doubt,<br>
When we view this problem as an undecidable residue class whose elements are universal DAGs, we see that<br>
You and I both know that<br>
And there you have it,<br>
And as easy as ABC,<br>
And then as quick as a wink,<br>
If you&rsquo;ve been paying attention you&rsquo;d realize that<br>
By the Pigeonhole Principle<br>
By circular reasoning we see that<br>
When we make the necessary and sufficient assumptions,<br>
It is beyond the scope of this course to prove that<br>
Only idealogues and sycophants would debate whether<br>
It is an unfortunately common misconception to doubt that<br>
By petitio principii, we assert that<br>
We may take for granted that<br>
For legal reasons I am required to disclose that<br>
It is elementary to show that<br>
I don&rsquo;t remember why, but you&rsquo;ll have to trust me that<br>
Following the logical steps, we might conclude<br>
We are all but forced to see that<br>
By the same logic,<br>
I&rsquo;m not even going to bother to prove that<br>
By Kant&rsquo;s Categorical imperative,<br>
Everyone and their mother can see that<br>
A child could tell you that<br>
It baffles me that you haven&rsquo;t already realized that<br>
Notice then that<br>
Just this once I will admit to you that<br>
Using the proper mindset one sees that<br>
Remember the basic laws of common sense:<br>
There is a lovely little argument that shows that<br>
Figure 2 (not shown here) makes it clear that<br>
Alas, would that it were not true that<br>
If I&rsquo;m being honest with you,<br>
According to the pointy-headed theorists sitting in their Ivory Towers in academia,<br>
We will take as an axiom that<br>
Accept for the moment that<br>
These are your words, not mine, but<br>
A little birdie told me that<br>
I heard through the grapevine that<br>
In the realm of constructive mathematics,<br>
It is a theorem from classical analysis that<br>
Life is too short to prove that<br>
A consequence of IUT is that<br>
As practitioners are generally aware,<br>
It is commonly understood that<br>
As the reader is no doubt cognizant,<br>
As an exercise for the reader, show that<br>
All the cool kids know that<br>
It is not difficult to see that<br>
Terry Tao told me in a personal email that<br>
Behold,<br>
Verify that<br>
In particular,<br>
Moreover,<br>
Yea verily<br>
By inspection,<br>
A trivial but tedious calculation shows that<br>
Suppose by way of contradiction that<br>
By a known theorem,<br>
Henceforth<br>
Recall that<br>
Wherefore said He unto them,<br>
It is the will of the Gods that<br>
It transpires that<br>
We find<br>
As must be obvious to the meanest intellect,<br>
It pleases the symmetry of the world that<br>
Accordingly,<br>
If there be any justice in the world,<br>
It is a matter of fact that<br>
It can be shown that<br>
Implicitly, then<br>
Ipso facto<br>
Which leads us to the conclusion that<br>
Which is to say<br>
That is,<br>
The force of deductive logic then drives one to the conclusion that<br>
Whereafter we find<br>
Assuming the reader&rsquo;s intellect approaches that of the writer, it should be obvious that<br>
Ergo<br>
With God as my witness,<br>
As a great man once told me,<br>
One would be hard-pressed to disprove that<br>
Even an applied mathematician would concede that<br>
One sees in a trice that<br>
You can convince yourself that<br>
Mama always told me<br>
I know it, you know it, everybody knows that<br>
Even the most incompetent T.A. could see,<br>
This won't be on the test, but<br>
Take it from me,<br>
Axiomatically,<br>
Naturally,<br>
A cursory glance reveals that<br>
As luck would have it,<br>
Through the careful use of common sense,<br>
By the standard argument,<br>
I hope I don&rsquo;t need to explain that<br>
According to prophecy,<br>
Only a fool would deny that<br>
It is almost obvious that<br>
By method of thinking,<br>
Through sheer force of will,<br>
Intuitively,<br>
I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t need to tell you that<br>
You of all people should realize that<br>
The Math Gods demand that<br>
The clever student will notice<br>
An astute reader will have noticed that<br>
It was once revealed to me in a dream that<br>
Even my grandma knows that<br>
Unless something is horribly wrong,<br>
And now we have all we need to show that<br>
If you use math, you can see that<br>
It holds vacuously that<br>
Now check this out:<br>
Barring causality breakdown, clearly<br>
We don't want to deprive the reader of the joy of discovering for themselves why<br>
One of the Bernoullis probably showed that<br>
Somebody once told me<br>
By extrapolation,<br>
Categorically,<br>
If the reader is sufficiently alert, they will notice that<br>
It&rsquo;s hard not to prove that<br>
The sophisticated reader will realize that<br>
In this context,<br>
It was Lebesque who first asked whether<br>
As is tradition,<br>
According to local folklore,<br>
We hold these truths to be self-evident that<br>
By simple induction,<br>
In case you weren&rsquo;t paying attention,<br>
A poor student or a particularly clever dog will realize immediately that<br>
Every student brought up in the American education system is told that<br>
Most experts agree that<br>
Sober readers see that<br>
And would you look at that:<br>
And lo!<br>
By abstract nonsense,<br>
I leave the proof to the suspicious reader that<br>
When one stares at the equations they immediately rearrange themselves to show that<br>
This behooves you to state that</p>
