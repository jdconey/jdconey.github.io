A selection of photos from 2021-02-12 suggesting that this path is impassable and should be tagged as such on OpenStreetMap.

Route planning software using OSM data (such as GraphHopper and OSRM) plot routes down this ginnel (for example from YCCC to Headingley Station) - which isn't ideal.

Because this route is clearly infrequently used despite (just about) existing on the ground, and it isn't a public right of way (it doesn't appear on the latest Ordnance Survey Explorer map as a public right of way), I think it is reasonable to tag it as abandoned on OpenStreetMap. I am fairly confident nobody has walked down this path out of choice in the past year in order to get to/from Headingley station and Kirkstall Lane.
