Some mates want to do a Bob Graham Round in 2025. 
I'm not committing until I do some training, then see how we go from there.
Hopefully this mini diary thing keeps me accountable.

    Slow start to this, away with pals for New Year in North Wales so got a bit of climbing in the legs the Saturday and Sunday before. 
    Then windy weather took hold making going out in the fells not a great option. 
    Then got ill and didn't run for four days, and it snowed making going out anywhere on Saturday and Sunday a non-starter.
    Good to see people regardless for New Year.

    Sluggish start to the week, finally getting over my mini-lurgy, and snow and ice weren't going anywhere (and nor were the trains to work half the time).
    Lurgy was the irritating sort that was perfectly fine to work with but not necessarily run.

    Mananged to leave the house on Wednesday for a tentative run round the woods and playing fields in the snow, and again the following afternoon wfh.

    Away meeting up with work colleagues on Saturday in Wales, and made up a good chunk of climbing on the Sunday on the excellently named Blorenge.
    Bumped into Ian who was doing reps and had a two hour head start on me, and he very kindly let me hang off the back of him. 7000' for me in one fell swoop pretty much

    Fine week at work, didn't run till Wednesday because of Sunday's Blorenge shenanigans. 
    It's quite flat round work but there are some very short hills (i.e. 0.1 miles long at 10%) in the park but decided to just focus my climbing on the weekend in the "proper" hills.

    Saturday was spent on Pendle doing reps of Big Dipper, seems like I'm not the only person to have done reps there before as there's a Strava segment.
    All in (having plodded up Mearley Moor first) I got some 7000' out of my 13.5 miles so a decent amount of climb done and time on feet.
    The legs don't hurt as much as they did last week either, which is good. The climbs are shorter though (about half the climb per rep) at a similar gradient.

    I did the Stanbury Splash on Sunday, did get a few comments about my mad day on Pendle and asking if I have any big plans. 
    Someone asked if I was training for a Paddy Buckley -- I said I'd do a Bob Graham before a Paddy Buckley.

    It is early days. But good to see mates, and do my first race since Tour of Pendle, even if I was about two minutes slower than last year.

    Busy week at work, legs felt much better than they did last week despite more climbing in the legs.
  <br>
  I decided to stick to the strategy of focusing my climbing at the weekends, which meant less worrying in the week about not getting enough climbing in, making for a less stressful existence.
  After all, I do this for fun, so no need to feel guilty in the week for not getting out in the dark in some flat fields.
  Saturday was spent meeting up with my pal Nick who might also have an inkling around this kind of thing, and we met roughly in the middle between us in Pendle (surprise surprise).
  It was more of a run than an all out mind-numbing rep session as last week, but a worthwhile outing in the sunshine with a mate all the same.
  After he left I decided to make the most of the light and the proximity to hills and got a bit more climbing in for my money, after a stop in the cafe for a can of full fat Coke and a lukewarm pie.
  I felt cold and sluggish, and that was before I got precipitated on (graupel, then sleet).
  <br>
  Saturday was the better of the two days of the weekend with strong-ish winds and some rain forecast on Sunday afternoon, so I made sure to get out on a local hill on Sunday, despite waking up on Sunday morning feeling a little bit naff.
  I found a steady gradient climb of about 800m or so with 100m of height gained (1/2 mile and ~300') which was all runnable, so I just set out to get as much in as I could before the weather started to turn.
  I lasted about two hours and got 3000' in, which was more than the minimum I'd said at the start I'd be happy with (2000'). And unlike Saturday, I was done before the rain started.

<h2>February 2025</h2>
  <button class="accordion">w/e 2nd Feb</button>
  <div class="panel">
    Another busy week at work, nice that it's not fully dark by the time I leave the office now though, and got some unspecified life admin done.
   Sunday's "feeling a bit naff" did turn out to be feeling run down by Sunday night/Monday morning (by my standards, which essentially meant I felt tired, a little bit snuffly and slightly more irritable than usual).
   I slept poorly on Sunday night and spent Monday at work drinking copious volumes of tea (I'm very lucky to have communal tea (Yorkshire) in the office) to keep on track as I had a few things I'd said I'd do this week. 
   Was generally productive despite computers not playing ball. 
   <br>This run-down-ness was enough to make me decide to pay attention to not getting ill, especially as I'd felt a bit off just after new year (little over three weeks ago), after a few days that I'd done some good running.
   Maybe this is due to the tactic of concentrating my big running over the weekend.
   I'm not sure what the solution to this is, but need to make sure that I can maintain some consistency. 
   <br>As it was, I didn't run till Saturday to recover fully. I felt fine by Tuesday night.
   Maybe the solution is to have rest weeks, so I decided to make this one and do something more sane on Saturday and Sunday, and not be <i>too</i> bothered about getting elevation in.
  Saturday was spent doing reps in Mytholmroyd: I thought the Trog was probably unwise given I was post-run-down-ness. 
  <br>
  I "raced" on Sunday at Ted's <i>Runners and Riders</i>, possibly the best catered race on the calendar, faster than last year but was better going underfoot.
  Good to see a load of mates and indulge in the usual spread of butties and cakes.
  I made the most of being in Yorkshire for the day so did some reps up the steep side of Simon's Seat from the Brownie Barn in the morning, where the enthusiastic proprietor sold me a high quality bacon ciabatta (definitely not a barm) before heading over to Appletreewick for the race.
