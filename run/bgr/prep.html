Some mates want to do a Bob Graham Round in 2025. 
I'm not committing until I do some training, then see how we go from there.
Hopefully this mini diary thing keeps me accountable. 
<p>
Since them declaring their intentions the ground has changed considerably and I'm close to being outed.
So I'll say it here: training for a Bob Graham Round is a necessary but not sufficient condition for deciding to do one.
<br>
Stay tuned.

    Slow start to this, away with pals for New Year in North Wales so got a bit of climbing in the legs the Saturday and Sunday before. 
    Then windy weather took hold making going out in the fells not a great option. 
    Then got ill and didn't run for four days, and it snowed making going out anywhere on Saturday and Sunday a non-starter.
    Good to see people regardless for New Year.

    Sluggish start to the week, finally getting over my mini-lurgy, and snow and ice weren't going anywhere (and nor were the trains to work half the time).
    Lurgy was the irritating sort that was perfectly fine to work with but not necessarily run.

    Mananged to leave the house on Wednesday for a tentative run round the woods and playing fields in the snow, and again the following afternoon wfh.

    Away meeting up with work colleagues on Saturday in Wales, and made up a good chunk of climbing on the Sunday on the excellently named Blorenge.
    Bumped into Ian who was doing reps and had a two hour head start on me, and he very kindly let me hang off the back of him. 7000' for me in one fell swoop pretty much

  <div class="panel">
    Fine week at work, didn't run till Wednesday because of Sunday's Blorenge shenanigans. 
    It's quite flat round work but there are some very short hills (i.e. 0.1 miles long at 10%) in the park but decided to just focus my climbing on the weekend in the "proper" hills.

    Saturday was spent on Pendle doing reps of Big Dipper, seems like I'm not the only person to have done reps there before as there's a Strava segment.
    All in (having plodded up Mearley Moor first) I got some 7000' out of my 13.5 miles so a decent amount of climb done and time on feet.
    The legs don't hurt as much as they did last week either, which is good. The climbs are shorter though (about half the climb per rep) at a similar gradient.

    I did the Stanbury Splash on Sunday, did get a few comments about my mad day on Pendle and asking if I have any big plans. 
    Someone asked if I was training for a Paddy Buckley -- I said I'd do a Bob Graham before a Paddy Buckley.

    It is early days. But good to see mates, and do my first race since Tour of Pendle, even if I was about two minutes slower than last year.
    <br>
    <b>Post-race analysis</b>: Ran fine, getting over ankle niggle head problems (i.e. I can "run" down hill now!). Progress.

  <button class="accordion">w/e 26th Jan</button>
  <div class="panel">
    Busy week at work, legs felt much better than they did last week despite more climbing in the legs.
  <br>
  I decided to stick to the strategy of focusing my climbing at the weekends, which meant less worrying in the week about not getting enough climbing in, making for a less stressful existence.
  After all, I do this for fun, so no need to feel guilty in the week for not getting out in the dark in some flat fields.
  Saturday was spent meeting up with my pal Nick who might also have an inkling around this kind of thing, and we met roughly in the middle between us in Pendle (surprise surprise).
  It was more of a run than an all out mind-numbing rep session as last week, but a worthwhile outing in the sunshine with a mate all the same.
  After he left I decided to make the most of the light and the proximity to hills and got a bit more climbing in for my money, after a stop in the cafe for a can of full fat Coke and a lukewarm pie.
  I felt cold and sluggish, and that was before I got precipitated on (graupel, then sleet).
  <br>
  Saturday was the better of the two days of the weekend with strong-ish winds and some rain forecast on Sunday afternoon, so I made sure to get out on a local hill on Sunday, despite waking up on Sunday morning feeling a little bit naff.
  I found a steady gradient climb of about 800m or so with 100m of height gained (1/2 mile and ~300') which was all runnable, so I just set out to get as much in as I could before the weather started to turn.
  I lasted about two hours and got 3000' in, which was more than the minimum I'd said at the start I'd be happy with (2000'). And unlike Saturday, I was done before the rain started.

<h2>February 2025</h2>
  <button class="accordion">w/e 2nd Feb</button>
  <div class="panel">
    Another busy week at work, nice that it's not fully dark by the time I leave the office now though, and got some unspecified life admin done.
   Sunday's "feeling a bit naff" did turn out to be feeling run down by Sunday night/Monday morning (by my standards, which essentially meant I felt tired, a little bit snuffly and slightly more irritable than usual).
   I slept poorly on Sunday night and spent Monday at work drinking copious volumes of tea (I'm very lucky to have communal tea (Yorkshire) in the office) to keep on track as I had a few things I'd said I'd do this week. 
   Was generally productive despite computers not playing ball. 
   <br>This run-down-ness was enough to make me decide to pay attention to not getting ill, especially as I'd felt a bit off just after new year (little over three weeks ago), after a few days that I'd done some good running.
   Maybe this is due to the tactic of concentrating my big running over the weekend.
   I'm not sure what the solution to this is, but need to make sure that I can maintain some consistency. 
   <br>As it was, I didn't run till Saturday to recover fully. I felt fine by Tuesday night.
   Maybe the solution is to have rest weeks, so I decided to make this one and do something more sane on Saturday and Sunday, and not be <i>too</i> bothered about getting elevation in.
  Saturday was spent doing reps in Mytholmroyd: I thought the Trog was probably unwise given I was post-run-down-ness. 
  <br>
  I "raced" on Sunday at Ted's <i>Runners and Riders</i>, possibly the best catered race on the calendar, faster than last year but was better going underfoot.
  Good to see a load of mates and indulge in the usual spread of butties and cakes.
  I made the most of being in Yorkshire for the day so did some reps up the steep side of Simon's Seat from the Brownie Barn in the morning, where the enthusiastic proprietor sold me a high quality bacon ciabatta (definitely not a barm) before heading over to Appletreewick for the race.
  <br>
  <b>Post-race analysis</b>: felt like I ran hard, pushed the pace when I felt like I could go quicker and did decently given I'd run already that morning. Couldn't hang on to my place on the last field but hey ho.
  <p></p>
  4 runs / 20 miles / 4h 11m / 6883'

  <button class="accordion">w/e 9th Feb</button>
  <div class="panel">
  Another week in the books, seemed to pick up a slight niggle after racing hard on Sunday and then standing around eating cake for an hour. Wonder why that might be?!
  Didn't play up too much so will keep an eye on it. My car survived its MOT so we're still go go go. Yet to name the Yaris, maybe Maureen. It has Pilks glass which really excited me, turns out others don't quite have the same level of enthusiasm for Pilks as I do.
  <p>
  The "usual" strategy played out again: do a bit of running in the week and focus on elevation at the weekend.
  Saturday was spent on Pendle getting some Big Dipper reps in: the first few dragged a bit (an impromptu snow shower didn't help) but we got there. Gradually warmed up to it and felt I had more in me if I wanted to do more, but I didn't.
  <p>
  Sunday was my return to Shropshire fell racing for some Long Mynd Valleys action. 
  I enjoyed (ish) the route when it was a champs race, though I died a death going up Yearlet then. I knew what was coming this time though, even if the route's changed since 2023. 
  Good to meet up with my former benevolent land baron Josh.
  I've always been beaten by my pal Ben at Shropshire races (and recently even outside Shropshire too) but he was safely on the other side of the world so I got a bye this time.
  It was claggy out, got taught early on not to blindly follow others and fortunately starting with my map and compass in hand meant I quickly corrected myself when the folk I was following were straying off-line.
  Ended up following a local until Grindle and I knew the way reasonably well from there on. Reasonable result, need to try and get better at descending with confidence.
  Pleased to hit the "magical" 10,000' number for the first time this year.

  <br>
  <b>Post-race analysis</b>: first A race since Tour of Pendle where I could only hobble downhill. Getting some confidence back slowly but need some trips to some big hills and the confidence to fall over going down them. All in, not bad. Top 20 finish so not to be sniffed at!

  <div class="panel">
  Another week done. Started the week feeling a bit sore after the weekend's shenanigans but this had eased by Wednesday.
  I spent a bit of time reflecting on my poor descending so at dinnertime on Friday I ventured from the office to practise my descending in Everton Park.
  This was quite enjoyable and felt like my confidence is starting to return.
  <p>
  With this in mind I had the "usual" session on Pendle on Saturday, missing out the mizzle in the process, but decided to try and focus on being quicker when descending rather than a pure endurance elevation session.
  It felt a bit quicker, still a way to go, and Strava seemed to suggest I was in fact moving quicker downhill than I had in the past (including on race day).
  Only managed 5 reps as it does get mind numbing, though I often feel better at the end than at the start with this. 
  Still, it's an efficient-ish way to get elevation in.
  I stayed a bit more local on Sunday, and do something more resembling a run. 
  I did a hilly loop round Winter Hill with a couple of extra reps in, and managed to eke out enough elevation to get 10000' for the week again. Success.

  Another week in the books. Did nothing till Thursday as too cold and wet. Spiced up my commuting by leaving my stuff at work and running from/to a station further down the line. 
  Thursday turned into a bit of a tempo effort (significantly net downhill), with going steady fast for the first 10k with a plan to push the pace for the last 5km (the thinking being this simulates pushing on tired legs. Dunno if it worked.
  <p>
  Saturday was High Cup Nick. I've done it three times now, it's just a nice day out so I thought I'd go for it. 
  I got round, but plans for maximising climb before/afterwards went to pot when I got sidetracked by nattering and cake.
  Sunday was a variation on the Calder Valley Round with a couple of mates to bring the week to a close with a semi-respectable total.
<br>
  <b>Post-race analysis</b>: Ran well, pushed hard when I needed to but bit soft on the descent. 
   I think it's lack of speedwork rather than all-out descending. I don't remember the descent being as rutted as it was.
   Only two minutes or so slower than two years ago when I was in the form of my life, which I probably lost on the descent or the very wet bog trotting in the gill.

<h2>March 2025</h2>
<button class="accordion">w/e 2nd March</button>
  <div class="panel">
  Feeling more spring-like. Usual shenanigans midweek, tried the run-commute Thursday/Friday as last week but this time did 6 by 4 mins on the old railway/canal. Acceptable if a bit slow, could've gone slower on the recoveries maybe but I have neglected speedwork since October.
  <p>
  Saturday was an outing in the Howgills, good to get proper hills in rather than Big Dipper reps. Got a bit soft and binned off two climbs because I was a bit worried about icy patches given snow on The Calf. It would've been fine really. Still got 7000' out of it.
  Sunday was a trot round Ilkley with a pal before watching the Ilkley Moor fell race. Good to have a natter, see some mates and get a few more miles in.

  Properly warming up now, Sunday was especially warm. First electrolyte consumption of the year.
  Thursday session was a 5km effort on the loop line. Reasonable, room for improvement.
  <p>
  Saturday was a run and natter in the Dales in the sunshine, good to have a proper catchup.
  Sunday was a return to Sedbergh for a variation on last week with a pal: again I binned off the last hill: but this time it was the heat rather than snow!
  Views for miles, many electrolytes and full fat Coke were required.

<button class="accordion">w/e 16th March</button>

  A familiar pattern of some easy miles midweek and some proper outings at the weekend. 
  Didn't feel like a "session" on Thursday on the commute home as has been usual, so I decided to try and run two hard kilometres with an easy kilometre in between on the loop line, which seemed like a fair compromise.
  <p>
  Saturday was the Hope Valley Round with a couple of pals: I wouldn't have gone to the effort of getting to Hathersage had a natter with mates not been on the cards. But it was a very worthwhile day out nonetheless.
  Sunday was a return to Pendle as I didn't fancy a huge drive or another 20 mile run, so Big Dipper in the sunshine was a nice contrast to the past. Shame about some of the streams being dry!
