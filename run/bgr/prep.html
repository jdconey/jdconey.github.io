Some mates want to do a Bob Graham Round in 2025. 
I'm not committing until I do some training, then see how we go from there.
Hopefully this mini diary thing keeps me accountable. 

<h2> January 2025</h2>

    Slow start to this, away with pals for New Year in North Wales so got a bit of climbing in the legs the Saturday and Sunday before. 
    Then windy weather took hold making going out in the fells not a great option. 
    Then got ill and didn't run for four days, and it snowed making going out anywhere on Saturday and Sunday a non-starter.
    Good to see people regardless for New Year.
    <p></p>
    3 runs / 20.3 miles / 4h 20m / 3405'

  <div class="panel">
    Sluggish start to the week, finally getting over my mini-lurgy, and snow and ice weren't going anywhere (and nor were the trains to work half the time).
    Lurgy was the irritating sort that was perfectly fine to work with but not necessarily run.

    Mananged to leave the house on Wednesday for a tentative run round the woods and playing fields in the snow, and again the following afternoon wfh.

    Away meeting up with work colleagues on Saturday in Wales, and made up a good chunk of climbing on the Sunday on the excellently named Blorenge.
    Bumped into Ian who was doing reps and had a two hour head start on me, and he very kindly let me hang off the back of him. 7000' for me in one fell swoop pretty much

    <p></p>
    3 runs / 26.2 miles / 6h 14m / 7870'

  <button class="accordion">w/e 19th Jan</button>
  <div class="panel">
    Fine week at work, didn't run till Wednesday because of Sunday's Blorenge shenanigans. 
    It's quite flat round work but there are some very short hills (i.e. 0.1 miles long at 10%) in the park but decided to just focus my climbing on the weekend in the "proper" hills.

    Saturday was spent on Pendle doing reps of Big Dipper, seems like I'm not the only person to have done reps there before as there's a Strava segment.
    All in (having plodded up Mearley Moor first) I got some 7000' out of my 13.5 miles so a decent amount of climb done and time on feet.
    The legs don't hurt as much as they did last week either, which is good. The climbs are shorter though (about half the climb per rep) at a similar gradient.

    I did the Stanbury Splash on Sunday, did get a few comments about my mad day on Pendle and asking if I have any big plans. 
    Someone asked if I was training for a Paddy Buckley -- I said I'd do a Bob Graham before a Paddy Buckley.

    It is early days. But good to see mates, and do my first race since Tour of Pendle, even if I was about two minutes slower than last year.
