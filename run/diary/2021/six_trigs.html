Originally <a href="http://www.andrewbibby.com/misc/sixtrigs.html" target="_blank">written about</a> by Andrew Bibby in the late 90s, before the CROW act, the six trigs challenge was mooted as a moorland loop taking in six trig points, on mostly pathless terrain.
The aim is simple: start in Hebden Bridge, take in the six trig points listed, and return to Hebden Bridge "tired but satisfied". It's advertised as 26 miles in length.

This was my second attempt at the Six Trigs Challenge from Hebden Bridge, the first attempt ending in failure after my planned stream to fill up my bottles was stagnant. 
I also blame it on ignoring a local's suggestion for approaching Hoof Stones (who regularly ran the route) and instead going more direct and ending up in tussocky hell. Not this time.

So with the weather having been very damp over the past few weeks, I thought that the streams would be fuller, but the bogs would hopefully not be too awful. 
This time, I'd learned my lesson, I'd packed an extra half litre of water, and I was going to follow the advice for approaching Hoof Stones. Paths are nice. I'd had in mind the rough schedule of a trig an hour, and somewhere under 7 hours would do me as I'd been invited to a barbecue that evening.
<p>
I caught the train destined for Blackpool North with everyone else in Leeds, apparently (it's half term, I discovered) and having survived the mayhem, I made it to Hebden Bridge station.
The lift sign at the station entertains me: there's no way it's original but they've made sure it's consistent with the rest of the station typography. Lovely stuff. Musings like this will keep me sane on a long run in the heat.
I bumped into a runner draining the dregs from his softflask as I descended from the station towards the park, I asked if he'd had a goodun, apparently he'd done 14, and had a bit more to go so presumably was continuing past the station.
<p>
I went rogue and went straight across the grass in the park and made for my (nominal) start point: bridge number 17 on the canal. 
I'd ummed and aahed over shoes, and opted for my fairly shiny new mudclaws (Â£50 woohoo) rather than my walshes, just because "26" miles in walshes wouldn't be the most enjoyable experience. 
Also I blamed the walshes for slowing me down on Tuesday night at a club run, it definitely wasn't my awful climbing/descending nor lack of fitness.
<p>
I set off unceremoniously, and had a pleasant little jog along the canal for half a mile or so, before a steep climb up through some woods to the track I planned to take.
The first footpath passes right through some gardens with a variety of "so Hebden Bridge" signage pointing the way before emerging on a higher track to a bowling green. 
Last time I passed this way, there were some folk playing bowls, but nobody today. The pubs are open, I suppose. Or they were off to Blackpool North with everyone else.
<p>
I hauled myself up the hill, very slowly, and allowed myself a breather before a pleasant jog along a contouring track towards Bridestones. 
Having done this route before, I was slightly annoyed at taking the wrong fork (rectified very quickly) at one junction, and annoying a friendly homeowner when I couldn't be bothered to get my map out to work out how to leave their yard. But I got there.
Once on the road approaching Bridestones, I could see the trig with its very nice white coat glinting in the sunshine. I remember last time, it had taken me just over an hour to get to Bridestones, but I had ran up the last hill so I'd make better time. 
I didn't fancy this today, and I took the hill at a more relaxed pace.
<p>
The next section was new to me, having decided to follow the local's advice from last time and was much more pleasant than the tussocks that I chose last time. The road section wasn't too busy.
I knew the next section down to the Widdop road and passed fine. I met some ramblers on the climb up from the Pennine Bridleway. 
When I brought up the heat as potentially too warm, I was told to wash my mouth out, I promised I would when I reached a stream.
Thankfully my stagnant stream from last time was flowing better, and I stopped to refill my bottles before the climb up Lad Law. 
No wanting to bail today, I was committing. The path up to Lad Law was very straightforward: the first section follows the oil road, built by an oil company in a fruitless attempt to drill for oil on the moor. 
From the end of the road, a very clear trod climbed up to the summit, and the highest point of the day. Importantly, it was also in Lancashire.

I knew the next section would be pathless and boggy (one <a href="http://www.barlickfellrunners.org.uk/media/advkontent/races14/magnificent_seven.pdf" target="_blank">online account</a> described it as "one of the most featureless boggy sh*t holes I have ever come across").
I took a bearing over to Crow Hill, and identified what looked to be the hill. 
I looked at the romer on the compass to have a rough guesstimate of the distance (about 3 km; on the 1:50k romer, not the 1:25k (oops) - no damage as I realised my blunder once at Crow Hill).
The bog was fine, perhaps because I was expecting it to be a bit poor, but it was mostly runnable or steady walking and before long I had made a beeline for the line of boundary stones where I'd pick up a rough path towards Alcomden Stones.
The boundary stones were rather a poor effort, but I found what looked to be the right place to run back into Yorkshire.
The path alongside a ditch was also alright with a couple of serious boggy bits, but nothing too awful, and I was soon at Alcomden Stones.
Here I picked up a proper path (bumped into some folk who'd spotted a lizard) and made it over to the trig. 
From previous experience I knew there was a nice path down to Top Withens, and I decided I'd stop there. 
This was a nice break, millionaire's shortbread was delightful, but I was very jealous of the folk nearby munching on a Gregg's.
<p>
The next section was back to fell terrain, after a short section on (normally lethal) flagstones on the Pennine Way I climbed up to the Stoop, a route I knew alright having done it in reverse in the past.
From the Stoop, I made the decision to maintain height and continued to Cock Hill on increasingly rough terrain; the mast being a useful feature to aim for.
Again, I was expecting this, so it wasn't too bad. Once across the road (at a bus stop!) and over a stile, the plan was to pick up the footpath to High Brown Knoll.
The Strava heatmap implied there was a path all the way, and the OS map showed a path on the ground and a public footpath all the way too.
<p>
I handrailed a fence, and hopped a gate (all the stiles seemed to have been dismantled, but this is all access land) and took a bearing towards my path.
I couldn't find one at all, and remained tussock hopping until about 100 m before the trig. I was irritated. On looking at my strava trace, I should have been to the west. 
I suspect that the OS path and the OpenStreetMap paths are not in the same locations. I did see a deer though. That was cool.

<p>
From here, I was tempted to straightline it to the final trig, but having experienced the lack of path from Crow Hill, I decided to follow the paths I could see on the ground.
This strategy proved successful, and I was soon there, and having a wee chat with some folk out for a walk.
Now with a barbecue calling, I descended down through the golf club, drag along the road, descent past some goats into the edge of the village and across the park to the bridge. Success, I got round.
<p>
There was some sort of drumming event going on in the park. The leader man's t shirt said "Straight Outta Hebden". This tickled me. On to the coop for ice cream and a bottle of pop. Happy days.

It's listed on various sites as being 26 miles, with a range of height climbed. 
This made me doubt my route choice between Withins and High Brown Knoll, but my strategy of maintaining height seemed like the one most in keeping with the challenge.
