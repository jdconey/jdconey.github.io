Current Status: In Testing. Images may be erratic. Check back on 1st November for hopefully, a full service. Let's hope we can get out and make the most of the season this year :-)
<p>
The tests at the mo are just making sure that the code to grab the images every hour and upload them here is working (8 am - 4 pm each day).

Current Status: This system stopped updating regularly at the end of April. Check back in November when hopefully we'll do the whole thing all over again.

Current Status: Everything is working alright. For now. Expect new images every hour from 8 am until 4 pm UK time.

Lots of enterprising folk and companies have installed webcams in various mountainous regions in Scotland.
This idea sprung about on a very relaxed wander into the CIC hut with some pals from my uni hillwalking club in the warmth of January 2020. 
One of us mentioned that whenever we wanted to check the webcams in Scotland of an evening after uni/work for an idea of snow conditions on the hill, it was nighttime so (surprisingly enough) the current webcam images were not of much use. 
This is aimed as a potential solution, allowing anyone to have a gander at snow conditions on the hill during daylight hours at any time of the day.
This is also useful for those of us who don't do any prep for a scottish winter weekend so can have a mooch on the way up. 
Hopefully, some folk, somewhere, may find it of use for looking at snow conditions through the week. Please don't sue me.

<p class="text-left">
The scripts to grab images run on the hour, every hour from 8 am until 4 pm UK time, 1st Nov until 1st May. In order to save space, I'm only going to keep the images from the last month or so online. If you're interested in older images, let me know and we'll sort something out. Or, if you think I should keep the images online for longer, let me know too please. I want this site to be vaguely useful.
These photos come with a health warning - I scrape the latest image from each site. All the images have date/timestamps <b>on each image</b> - do check these as it is fairly likely the cam could be down so you're seeing an image from a day/week/month/year ago. The names of the directories in the archive are the date/time that the images are grabbed from the web and may bear no relation whatsoever to the actual date/time of the photos within.
I would like to hope, however, that these times are roughly similar! But be aware in case it looks ace in a certain region, despite the forecast, only to find out that the webcam images are from last season.

<p class="text-left"><b>Some incoherent ramblings</b>
<br>
The smorgasbord of weather forecasting tools out there on the Internet is of immense help when planning trips. 
Most if not all forecast producers rely on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, which basically try to numerically solve the differential equations describing the atmosphere for future points in time, given the best guess of current atmospheric conditions.
Gone are the days of the forecast being absolutely wrong (compare the week's warning we had for Storm Ciara/Dennis in 2020 with the 6 hours warning for the 'Great Storm' in 1987). 
Computer power has increased hugely since the 1950s when NWP models were first invented, and this has helped <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cdanfort/nolink/atmos/nature-review-2015.pdf" target="_blank">improve forecasts</a> accordingly. 
The Met Office like to bandy around that their 4 day forecasts in 2016 <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/what/accuracy-and-trust/comparing-forecast-accuracy" target="_blank">were as accurate</a> as a 1 day forecast was in 1980.

<p class="text-left">
The resolution of forecasts have improved, both spatially and temporally. For example, the Met Office's global model has gridpoints 17 km apart, while their UKV model for just the UK has gridpoints 1.5 km apart. 
Bear this in mind when using sites such as Meteoblue, WxCharts and Windy, as it's important to know what the resolution of the forecast you're looking at is.
You would expect that the closer together the grid points in a model are, the more accurate the forecast is going to be.

<p class="text-left">
I mentioned <i>ensemble forecasts</i> in the description for WxCharts. 
These work on the principle that we can't know exactly what the precise state of the atmosphere is when we start running a NWP model. 
So, an ensemble forecast is the same forecast run multiple times with slightly tweaked initial conditions/parameterisations.
Then, you have a good visualisation of potential outcomes over the next few days. 
Spaghetti plots are a nice way to look at this as you watch the different ensemble members slowly grow apart as time goes on.
Typically, ensemble forecasts are run on a lower resolution than the single equivalent <i>deterministic</i> forecast - this is worth bearing in mind.
