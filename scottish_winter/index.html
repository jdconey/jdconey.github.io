<h1>Scottish Winter Webcam Archive</h1>
Sorry, my PhD took over things. Since I started this 4 years ago, some better archives are available and these are linked below.
Also, my code started breaking and I could never get around to getting to work from cron, despite it working fine otherwise. Alas.
Maybe if I get time to sort this out I might make things operational again.

  <li><a href="https://wetter3.de/">Wetter3: "Aktuelle Wetterkarten"</a>, a handy archive of weather charts to geek out on. The name's a pun, I think. (in English <a href="https://wetter3.de/index_en.html">here</a>.)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.wxcharts.com/">WXCharts</a>, as seen in the tabloids</a>. Pick the GFS +384 run for maximum clickbait!</li>
