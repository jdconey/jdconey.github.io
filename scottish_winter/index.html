Lots of enterprising folk and companies have installed webcams in various mountainous regions in Scotland.
This idea sprung about on a very relaxed wander into the CIC hut with some pals from my uni hillwalking club in the warmth of January 2020. 
One of us mentioned that whenever we wanted to check the webcams in Scotland of an evening after uni/work for an idea of snow conditions on the hill, it was nighttime so (surprisingly enough) the current webcam images were not of much use. 
This website allows you to view webcam images from during daylight hours, from around the past month or so, for the Scottish mountains. 
This means you now don't have to be on the web looking at snowy (or not) mountains when you should be writing a thesis or performing complicated dentistry.
This is also useful for those of us who don't do any prep for a scottish winter weekend so can have a mooch on the way up. 
Hopefully, some folk, somewhere, may find it of use for looking at snow conditions through the week. Please don't sue me.

<p class="text-left">
You can access the images by using the links in the black navbar at the top of this page. If you're on a mobile, use the "hamburger" icon to access the links.
The "Latest images" webpages contains the most recent images grabbed from the webcams, and the archive pages contain older images, in a (hopefully) logical, organised fashion.
I've grouped the images into roughish areas: Cairngorms (i.e. the webcam images from the Cairn Gorm ski centre); Glencoe & Crianlarich (from the ski centre and the OMC hut in Crianlarich); Ben Nevis (images from round Lochaber-ish) and Nevis Range ski centre.

<p class="text-left">
The scripts to grab images run every twenty minutes from 8 am until 4 pm UK time, 1st November until 30th April. In order to try to keep things vaguely tidy, I'm only going to keep the images from the last five days online. I'm hoping to keep older images locally on my machine, so this 5 day limit could be adjusted as time/demand/space allows. 
These photos come with a health warning - I scrape the latest image from each site. Most of the images have date/timestamps <b>on each image</b>. 
The names of the directories in the archive are the date/time that the images are grabbed from the web and are not necessarily the actual date/time that the the photos within were taken.

<li>The BBC sadly sold out to some other company (dunno, I hadn't heard of them either), leaving behind the Met Office as the forecast provider. 
Unfortunately the new provider (nah still can't remember what they're called) weren't ready in time so the Met Office continued providing weather forecasts to the BBC for an an extra year (and were probably healthily renumerated with licence fee money for this company's cockup).
The <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/specialist-forecasts/coast-and-sea/print/shipping-forecast" target="_blank">Shipping Forecast</a>, is still "issued by the Met Office, on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency".</li>

The smorgasbord of weather forecasting tools out there on the Internet is of immense help when planning trips. 
Most if not all forecast producers rely on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, which basically try to numerically solve the differential equations describing the atmosphere for future points in time, given the best guess of current atmospheric conditions.
Gone are the days of the forecast being absolutely wrong (compare the week's warning we had for Storm Ciara/Dennis in 2020 with the 6 hours warning for the 'Great Storm' in 1987). 
Computer power has increased hugely since the 1950s when NWP models were first invented, and this has helped <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cdanfort/nolink/atmos/nature-review-2015.pdf" target="_blank">improve forecasts</a> accordingly. 
The Met Office like to bandy around that their 4 day forecasts in 2016 <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/what/accuracy-and-trust/comparing-forecast-accuracy" target="_blank">were as accurate</a> as a 1 day forecast was in 1980.

<p class="text-left">
The resolution of forecasts have improved, both spatially and temporally. For example, the Met Office's global model has gridpoints 17 km apart, while their UKV model for just the UK has gridpoints 1.5 km apart. 
Bear this in mind when using sites such as Meteoblue, WxCharts and Windy, as it's important to know what the resolution of the forecast you're looking at is.
You would expect that the closer together the grid points in a model are, the more accurate the forecast is going to be.

<p class="text-left">
I mentioned <i>ensemble forecasts</i> in the description for WxCharts. 
These work on the principle that we can't know exactly what the precise state of the atmosphere is when we start running a NWP model. 
So, an ensemble forecast is the same forecast run multiple times with slightly tweaked initial conditions/parameterisations.
Then, you have a good visualisation of potential outcomes over the next few days. 
Spaghetti plots are a nice way to look at this as you watch the different ensemble members slowly grow apart as time goes on.
Typically, ensemble forecasts are run on a lower resolution than the single equivalent <i>deterministic</i> forecast - this is worth bearing in mind.
Both deterministic and ensemble forecasts have their use.

	  It's relatively simple to be honest. Most of the webcam images are just jpgs, which are updated somewhere between every minute to every twenty (depending on the webcam). The webcam images stay at the same url.
I've rigged up a few bash and Python scripts to download these images.
I've got a Raspberry Pi sitting on my desk which has <code>cron</code> set up to run the scripts every twenty minues from 8 am till 4 pm. I pull the image repository from GitHub, update it with the new images, and push the changes back to GitHub.
There's a separate script to tidy things up and archive the older images onto a usb stick plugged into the Pi. 
Then everything magically works and I don't lose long weekends to crying at the console window nor browsing Stack Overflow for days on end when I should be doing work instead.
<br>
All worth it in the end, I promise.
<br>
If you are interested at looking at my omnishambles of a code setup, they're all for perusal in the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/jdconey/winter_code" target="_blank">here</a>. What can I say - I did a maths degree, not a computer science one.
<br>
One future job is to see if I can use machine learning to categorise each image to say whether it's snowy or not & then that'd be a cool way to see how many snowy days we have. That's vaguely related to the PhD I'm starting, honest.
